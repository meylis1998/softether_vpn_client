# OpenVPN Initialization and Status Fix

## Problem 1: OpenVPN Initialization Error
The app was encountering an "OpenVPN need to be initialized" error when trying to connect. This happened because there was a timing issue where the connection attempt was being made before the OpenVPN library was fully initialized.

## Solution 1: Better Initialization Handling
We implemented a more robust initialization mechanism:

1. Added initialization state tracking variables:
   - `_isInitializing`: Tracks if initialization is currently in progress
   - `_isInitialized`: Tracks if initialization has completed successfully
   - `_initializationCompleter`: A Completer to handle async waiting for initialization

2. Improved `_initializeOpenVPN` method:
   - Prevents duplicate initialization attempts
   - Uses a Completer to allow other methods to wait for initialization to complete
   - Properly sets initialization state flags
   - Better error handling

3. Added `_ensureOpenVPNInitialized` method:
   - Ensures OpenVPN is properly initialized before any connection attempt
   - Checks if initialization is needed, waits for ongoing initialization, or triggers initialization

4. Updated `_connectOpenVPN` method:
   - Calls `_ensureOpenVPNInitialized()` before attempting to connect
   - Improved error handling with a retry mechanism

## Problem 2: App Starting in "Connecting" State
The app was starting in a "connecting" state without any user action. This was caused by the OpenVPN library sending initial status/stage values during initialization that our code didn't properly handle, causing it to default to 'connecting'.

## Solution 2: Better Status/Stage Handling
We improved the handling of OpenVPN callbacks to properly manage initial states:

1. Enhanced `_handleOpenVpnStageChange` method:
   - Properly parses stage strings that might be in the format "VPNStage.disconnected"
   - For unknown stages at startup (when no config is selected), defaults to 'disconnected' instead of 'connecting'
   - Only defaults to 'connecting' when there's an active connection process

2. Enhanced `_handleOpenVpnStatusChange` method:
   - Changed the default status from 'connecting' to 'disconnected'
   - For unknown statuses at startup (when no config is selected), defaults to 'disconnected' instead of 'connecting'
   - Only defaults to 'connecting' when there's an active connection process

## How the Fix Works
1. When `VpnConnectionDataSourceImpl` is instantiated, it starts the OpenVPN initialization process
2. During initialization, the OpenVPN library sends initial status/stage updates
3. Our improved handlers now correctly interpret these initial updates as a 'disconnected' state
4. When a user initiates a connection, the status properly transitions to 'connecting'
5. If an "need to be initialized" error occurs during connection, the code resets the initialization state and retries

## Testing
The app builds successfully for Android with these changes. The next step is to test it on a device to ensure it:
1. Starts in a 'disconnected' state
2. Properly connects to OpenVPN servers without initialization errors
