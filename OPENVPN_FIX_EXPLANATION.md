# OpenVPN Initialization Fix

## Problem
The application was encountering an error "OpenVPN need to be initialized" when trying to establish OpenVPN connections. This happened because there was a timing issue where the connection attempt was being made before the OpenVPN library was fully initialized.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `VpnConnectionDataSourceImpl` constructor called `_initializeOpenVPN()` but didn't wait for it to complete before allowing connections.
2. There was no mechanism to ensure initialization was complete before attempting to connect.
3. The error handling for the "need to be initialized" error was incomplete.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Initialization State Tracking
We added three new instance variables to track the initialization state:
- `_isInitializing`: Tracks if initialization is currently in progress
- `_isInitialized`: Tracks if initialization has completed successfully
- `_initializationCompleter`: A Completer to handle async waiting for initialization

### 2. Improved `_initializeOpenVPN` Method
- Added checks to prevent duplicate initialization attempts
- Used a Completer to allow other methods to wait for initialization to complete
- Properly set the initialization state flags
- Added better error handling that completes the completer with an error if initialization fails

### 3. Added `_ensureOpenVPNInitialized` Method
This new method ensures that OpenVPN is properly initialized before any connection attempt:
- Checks if initialization is needed
- Waits for ongoing initialization to complete if needed
- Triggers initialization if not already done

### 4. Updated `_connectOpenVPN` Method
- Added a call to `_ensureOpenVPNInitialized()` before attempting to connect
- Improved error handling for initialization errors
- Added a retry mechanism that resets the initialization state and reinitializes if the "need to be initialized" error occurs

### 5. Added `_resetInitializationState` Method
This method resets the initialization state flags, allowing for clean retries if initialization fails.

## How the Fix Works
1. When `VpnConnectionDataSourceImpl` is instantiated, it starts the OpenVPN initialization process
2. When a connection is requested, `_connectOpenVPN` calls `_ensureOpenVPNInitialized()`
3. `_ensureOpenVPNInitialized()` checks the state:
   - If already initialized, it returns immediately
   - If initializing, it waits for the Completer to complete
   - If not initialized and not initializing, it triggers initialization
4. If an "need to be initialized" error occurs during connection, the code resets the initialization state and retries

## Testing
The fix has been compiled and built successfully for Android. The next step is to test it on a device to ensure it resolves the connection issue.
